# Nuts-center-iOS-game-

An interesting iOS game (Nuts center, people go nuts while playing it!!!) through which we can arrange the randomly generated numbers. The game generates 16 tiles of random numbers on each run and user has to re-arrange the numbers in an order either horizontally or vertically. Also keeps track of user's performance using a Timer. Added database to store Username, Password and time taken to play

* Developed the game from scratch using Xcode 7.3 IDE
*	Used Touch, Tap and gestures to identify the user movement 
*	Added Timer to track the performance of player
*	Implemented Pause and Resume timer functionalities to make the game user friendly
*	Users can Sign In if he/she is a returning user or can Sign Up for new users
*	Data entered by user is validated and appropriate alerts are shown accordingly
*	Persisted data using SQLite3 Database
*	Able to observe changes in data using SQLite Manager, a tool of Mozilla Firefox
*	Time is updated in database only if the user completes the game successfully, else no changes are done to database

Environment
Xcode 7.3, Swift, SQLite3 database, SQLite Manager
